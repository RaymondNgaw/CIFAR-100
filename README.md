# CIFAR-100

-- Motivation
This was to test how well EfficientNetB0 would run against the CIFAR-100 dataset
In particular, we're using EfficientNetB0 to test 
  1. How well classification would be against prior known methods
  2. Efficiency to run a model on such a dataset (given the limitations of my machine)

-- Build Status
Complete

-- Framework
  Keras
    EfficientNetB0
  Tensorflow
  Albumentations
 
-- Installation
This script uses python 3.8.5.
Use version 3.7 at the very least.
  
-- Reference
You can find the CIFAR-100 dataset here:
  https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

-- Update
Upon reentering this script, I had accidentally removed the plots for loss and accuracy.
As my previous runs of this were relatively long, I've decided against testing the whole code again to bring up those plots.
